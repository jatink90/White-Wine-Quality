## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing the physicochemical properties of white wine and predicting its quality using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The dataset used is sourced from the [YBI Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/refs/heads/main/WhiteWineQuality.csv), and the project is structured to explore data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

## **Key Features**
- **Objective**: Predict white wine quality based on its physicochemical properties.
- **Dataset**: A detailed dataset containing multiple features like acidity, sugar, and alcohol levels.
- **Model**: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for multi-class classification.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualizations**: Heatmaps, distribution plots, and more for understanding correlations and data distribution.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of the following features:
- **Fixed Acidity**: Concentration of non-volatile acids.
- **Volatile Acidity**: Amount of acetic acid.
- **Citric Acid**: Enhances flavor and freshness.
- **Residual Sugar**: Sugar remaining after fermentation.
- **Chlorides**: Salt content.
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Protects wine from spoilage.
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Free and bound SO2 levels.
- **Density**: Related to alcohol and sugar content.
- **pH**: Acidity or alkalinity level.
- **Sulphates**: Stabilizing agents contributing to flavor.
- **Alcohol**: Percentage of alcohol in wine.
- **Quality**: Wine quality score (target variable).

## **Results**
- Achieved accurate predictions of wine quality using the SVC classifier.
- Visualized key patterns and correlations in the dataset.
- Evaluated model performance with confusion matrix and classification report.
